    "content": "I have not seen a clock in a web-based user interface in a long time. This makes sense — they are pretty redundant these days. You have a clock on your watch, on your mobile device, and on your desktop, and those are just the digital versions available at a glance. Nonetheless, the process of building a clock can reveal a lot about how a platform works."

HTML and CSS provide us with a number of tools to display content in rows and columns. Making a calendar component should be easy, right? Right?"

In Ionic React 5.6, we packaged up a new set of hooks for controlling our overlay components that we think you might like. What is an overlay you ask? It’s the term we give components that display over your current content, such as alerts, modals, toasts, etc."
